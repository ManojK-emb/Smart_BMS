# Smart_BMS

Battery management is the most important part of Li-ion battery powered devices as the
usage of these devices are getting increased in all fields like EV. For smoother operation
these batteries has to be monitored and Controlled and managed properly at a regular
interval of time during charging and discharging. So the proposed system will monitor
the status of battery in real time.
This project mainly focuses on lithium battery pack used in Cars, Power bank and many
electronic devices. So the project is designed in such a way that it continuosly senses the
voltage levels of the battery for protecting it from over charging and discharging. Also
temperature monitoring is also included in the circuit so that whenever battery gets
heated the system will automatically cut off the power supply or load.

The Li-ion batteries are considered to be most reliable power source for wide range of
applications in consumer electronics including portable devices like mobile, laptops and
home automation products, Ev and so on. Because of their slow discharge rate when not
in use and high open circuit voltage they have been used in military, Electric vehicles.
The Li-ion batteries used in Electric vehicles consists of a Battery Management System
commonly called as BMS consist of circuitry for protecting the battery from
overcharging/discharging and thermal protection. But we cannot directly visualize the
data for real time analysis. The proposed system helps us to Visualize and Monitor the
sensed parameters remotely with the help of IOT

## METHODOLOGY
The proposed system of BMS helps the consumer to view the real time data of Battery
pack locally as well as in Cloud. The BMS consists of a voltage sensing unit to sense the
input voltage and also the output voltage of the battery to load and monitors individual
cell voltage. Then the current sensing unit monitors the overall current of the battery. I
have used a temperature sensor to monitor the battery pack temperature. All these
parameters are sensed by sensors and monitored by microcontroller if any of the parameters
goes above or below the threshold value then the  microcontroller will give alert in
cloud and in locally with the help of buzzer.
